# About

I am Colin Flanagan and currently I am senior undergraduate student getting a double major in Chemistry and Mathematics from Hood College. I was born and raised in Baltimore County, Maryland, attending St. Pius X for middle and elementary and Calvert Hall for highschool. I earned the Presidential honors in eighth grade, went on and became a Brother Tom Miller Scholar, played Varsity Football, while also focusing on academics, family, and friends. At the start of my college career I wanted to work in Environmental Science and Policy but quickly saw both my skill and passion for my Chemistry and Math classes grow. Undecided which to choose, I chose both paths to major in. During my time at Hood I have strived in academics regularly being at the top of my class in all subjects GPA 3.95 and ranked 30th in a class of 357 as of Spring 2025, was selected as 1 of 11 students to participate in a research experience for undergraduate students at the University of Southern Mississippi in polymer chemisrty and machine learning, and was selected for a grant to do summer research for Hood College's Summer Research Institute in physics and machine learning. Currently I am looking for internships as a Chemist, Chemical Engineer, or Data Analytics Position.

Some of my hobbies outside of school and the perilous journey for knowledge include playing instruments such as the guitar and piano, skateboarding, playing videogames, spending time with my amazing girlfriend, fishing, hiking, camping, fixing cars, and watching films. Music for me includes classic, punk, and alternative rock (plus some hip hop). Some of my favorite videogames include The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask, Dark Souls III, Rocket League, Terraria, and Minecraft. Movies you need to watch include The Inglorious Bastard, Goodfellas, and Interstellar.
